## 1. Product Overview

A web platform where individuals and businesses upload a short intro video and their personal or brand details. The platform generates a **unique, print-ready QR code** — branded with the Champions Ranch logo — tied to that video.

When anyone scans the QR code with a phone camera, the browser opens instantly. The camera stays active. The creator's video **plays directly on top of the printed QR code in augmented reality** — tracking the QR's position, tilt, and rotation in real time so the video appears to live inside the card.

**The same QR is both the scan trigger (URL) and the AR tracking marker (image target).** No app download. No separate card image needed. Just print and hand out.

**The experience in one sentence:** A recruiter scans a QR on a business card, and the cardholder's face appears — playing a video intro right on the card, following every movement of the card as if the video is printed on it.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Business cards are static and forgettable. Existing digital alternatives (LinkedIn QR, HiHello, Blinq) just open a profile page — they don't create a memorable moment. There is no product today that delivers a cinematic, AR-anchored video experience directly from a physical card, in the browser, with zero friction for the recipient.

This platform fills that gap for professionals, creators, and brands who want to make a lasting impression at the moment of the handshake.

---

## 3. Target Users

| User Type | Primary Use Case |
|---|---|
| Professionals / Executives | Personal intro video that plays when card is scanned |
| Real Estate Agents | Property walkthrough or agent intro on card |
| Creators / Influencers | Showreel or personality video on card |
| Brands / Startups | Product demo or brand story on card |
| Event Speakers | Talk teaser or bio video on badge/lanyard |
| Sales Teams | Pitch video attached to leave-behind material |

- Shareable non-AR preview link: `https://app.domain.com/preview/{slug}` — shows video in standard player for desktop sharing

---

### 5.2 AR Video Viewer — The Core Experience

The page that opens when the QR is scanned. Runs entirely in the mobile browser. **Zero app install.**

#### Page Load Sequence
1. URL `https://app.domain.com/v/{slug}` opens in browser
2. API call: fetch card metadata (video URL, `.mind` target URL, owner details)
3. Show loading screen with creator's name and thumbnail while assets download
4. Camera permission prompt displayed with clear explanation ("Point your camera at the QR code to watch the video")
5. On permission granted:
   - Rear camera activated via `getUserMedia({ video: { facingMode: 'environment' } })`
   - Camera feed rendered as full-screen background `<video>` element
   - MindAR initialised with the card's `.mind` target file
6. "Point camera at the QR code on the card" instruction overlay shown
7. When QR detected: instruction overlay fades, video begins playing over QR

#### AR Video Overlay Behaviour
- Video plane rendered at the exact dimensions of the detected QR
- Perspective-correct 3D transform (`matrix3d`) updated every frame from MindAR pose matrix
- Video covers the QR completely — QR is not visible during playback
- Video plays looped, **muted by default** (browser autoplay policy requires this)
- Subtle glow/shadow on video plane edges for depth realism
- Tap anywhere on the video → toggle sound on/off (icon indicator)
- Tap outside the video / swipe down → dismiss AR, return to camera-only view
- Video loops until dismissed or page closed

#### UI Overlays (minimal, non-intrusive)
- Bottom-left: creator's name + title (small text, fades after 3s)
- Bottom-right: sound icon (muted/unmuted state)
- Top-right: close (×) button
- All overlays semi-transparent, disappear on full-screen tap

#### Fallback States
| Condition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Camera permission denied | Show video in standard player with message: "Enable camera access to see the AR experience" |
| Browser does not support WebRTC | Show video in standard player |
| Card not found / inactive | Show "This card is no longer active" screen |
| QR not detected after 10s | Show "Having trouble? Make sure the QR is well-lit and fully visible" hint |
| Video fails to load | Show error with retry button |

#### Browser Support
- Chrome Android 88+
- Safari iOS 14.3+
- Samsung Internet 14+
- Firefox Android (standard player fallback only — no WebRTC getUserMedia in FF)

## 6. AR Implementation

### Core Concept

The platform-generated QR code is both the **URL trigger** (native camera scans it and opens the browser) and the **AR image marker** (MindAR tracks its position in 3D space). This means no separate card image upload is ever needed from the creator.

### Why QR Codes Are Ideal AR Markers

- **High contrast:** Black modules on white background — optimal for computer vision feature extraction
- **Dense feature points:** A typical QR code yields 400–600 ORB keypoints — far more than most natural images
- **Uniqueness:** No two QR codes encode the same data, so each card's marker is globally unique — zero false-positive tracking matches
- **Print determinism:** The PNG saved server-side is bit-for-bit identical to what gets printed — the compiled marker matches the physical card perfectly

### Tracking Library: `mind-ar.js` (Image Tracking Mode)

MindAR uses a FAST + BRIEF feature detector compiled to WebAssembly, running at 30fps in the browser. It outputs a 4×4 homogeneous transformation matrix per frame representing the detected image's position and orientation relative to the camera.

**Tracking pipeline:**
```
Camera frame (30fps)
    → FAST corner detection on grayscale
    → BRIEF descriptor extraction
    → BF-matcher against compiled .mind descriptors
    → Homography estimation (RANSAC)
    → Pose matrix (4×4) output
    → CSS matrix3d() applied to video plane <div>
```

**Fallback: `jsQR`**
Used only during initial detection (before MindAR locks on). `jsQR` decodes the QR's four corner points and computes a rough homography for an immediate approximate overlay, which MindAR then takes over and stabilises.

### Server-Side Marker Compilation

When a card is created, the backend runs:
```bash
# MindAR CLI compiler (Node.js child_process)
mindar-image-compiler --input qr-1000px.png --output qr.mind
```

The `.mind` file (~50–200KB) contains the pre-computed feature descriptors. It is stored alongside the video and served to the AR viewer on demand. Compilation takes 5–15 seconds and runs in a BullMQ background job.

### Video Plane Geometry

The video overlay `<div>` is:
- **Width/height:** 1:1 (square, matching QR aspect ratio)
- **Position:** Centred on the detected QR anchor point
- **Transform:** `transform: matrix3d(m00, m01, ..., m33)` — updated every animation frame
- **z-index:** Above camera feed, below UI overlays
- The video `<video>` element fills the div 100%×100% with `object-fit: cover`

### Edge Cases & Handling

| Scenario | Handling |
|---|---|
| Low light | MindAR confidence score drops → show "improve lighting" hint after 3s of no lock |
| Fast motion blur | MindAR's Kalman filter interpolates between frames — acceptable up to ~60°/s rotation |
| QR partially occluded | Level H error correction keeps QR scannable; MindAR tracks remaining visible features |
| Multiple QR codes in frame | Track only the first locked target — ignore subsequent detections |
| Portrait vs landscape phone | Video plane inherits device orientation via screen.orientation API |
| Tracking lost mid-playback | Video pauses and freezes in last known position; resumes when QR re-detected |

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| AR tracking frame rate | ≥ 25 fps on iPhone 12+ and mid-range Android (Snapdragon 778+) |
| Time from QR scan to video playing | < 3 seconds on 4G |
| MindAR `.mind` file size | < 200 KB |
| Total viewer page JS bundle | < 1.5 MB gzipped |
| Video buffering start | < 1 second (H.264 faststart, 720p) |

### Video Storage Strategy

| Option | Description | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **MongoDB GridFS** | Video chunks stored in MongoDB as binary GridFS documents. Zero extra infra. | MVP — simple, no additional services |
| **Cloudflare R2** | Object storage + CDN edge delivery. Fast globally, low egress cost. | Production, when storage > 5 GB or global users |

**Decision:** Start with GridFS for MVP. Migrate to R2 when storage exceeds 5 GB. The `videoUrl` field is a CDN URL in both cases — the viewer never changes.

---

## 9. Processing Pipeline

Every card creation triggers a BullMQ job queue sequence. All steps run server-side in background workers.

```
STEP 1 — Video Storage
  Raw upload saved to GridFS (or R2 staging)

STEP 2 — FFmpeg Transcode
  Input:  original file (any format)
  Output: H.264 MP4, 720p max, CRF 23, AAC audio, -movflags faststart
  Also:   extract JPEG thumbnail at t=0s and t=2s → save to storage

STEP 3 — QR Generation
  Library: `qrcode` npm (Node Canvas backend)
  Size:    1000×1000px
  EC:      Level H
  Style:   Black modules, white background
  Logo:    Champions Ranch PNG composited at centre (15% of canvas)
           — logo is resized to 150×150px, placed at (425, 425)
           — white square padding behind logo to prevent module collision
  Output:  PNG + SVG → saved to storage → card.qrImageUrl set

STEP 4 — Print Package Assembly
  Generate card mockup PNG (QR placed on 3.5×2" card template at 300 DPI)
  Generate sticker sheet PDF (20× QR at 1×1" on A4 via PDFKit)
  Write README.txt
  Bundle all into ZIP → card.printPackUrl set

STEP 5 — MindAR Target Compilation
  Input:  qrImageUrl PNG
  Output: .mind binary file (~50–200 KB)
  Method: mindar-image-compiler (Node child_process, ~5–15s)
  Result: card.targetFileUrl set

STEP 6 — Status Update
  card.status = "ready"
  Emit WebSocket event to dashboard: { type: "card:ready", cardId }
  Creator sees real-time status change in dashboard
```

**Error handling:** If any step fails, `card.status = "error"` and `card.errorMsg` is set. Dashboard shows a retry button that re-queues the failed step.

---

## 10. AI Integration

AI features are **Phase 2** (post-MVP) but the architecture is defined now so the pipeline can accommodate them without refactoring.

### Use Cases

| Feature | Trigger | Model | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Video analysis | After transcode completes | Gemini 1.5 Pro Vision via OpenRouter | Watch the uploaded video, auto-fill `ownerName`, `ownerTitle`, `company`, generate a 2-sentence bio |
| Script coach | Pre-upload screen | Claude Haiku via Anthropic API | "Tell us your role and we'll suggest what to say in your 30-second intro" |

### Why Gemini 1.5 Pro Vision

- Only model with native video file understanding (not just frames)
- Can process up to 1 hour of video in a single API call
- Via OpenRouter: no direct Google API key management needed
- OpenRouter model ID: `google/gemini-pro-1.5`

### OpenRouter Integration (server-side only)

```javascript
// Called after Step 2 (transcode) completes, video URL is public
const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'google/gemini-pro-1.5',
    messages: [{
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: `Watch this video introduction. Extract and return JSON:
                 { "name": "", "title": "", "company": "", "bio": "" }
                 Bio should be 1–2 sentences, professional tone.`
        },
        {
          type: 'video_url',
          video_url: { url: card.videoUrl }
        }
      ]
    }]
  })
})
```

**Security:** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is server-side only. Never sent to the frontend. Never logged.

## 14. Security

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Video URL exposure | GridFS: auth-gated stream endpoint. R2: pre-signed URLs with 1-hour expiry |
| QR slug enumeration | 8-char nanoid from 64-char alphabet = 64^8 ≈ 281 trillion combinations |
| Scan endpoint abuse | Rate limit: max 10 scan events per hashed IP per card per hour via Redis sliding window |
| File upload abuse | MIME type check + magic bytes validation (reject non-video at byte level). 200MB hard limit at multipart layer |
| XSS | React's JSX escaping + strict CSP header: `default-src 'self'; media-src blob: https:` |
| CORS | API restricted to known frontend origin via Fastify CORS plugin |
| Secrets | OpenRouter key, MongoDB URI, JWT secret — environment variables only, never in code or logs |
| Auth brute force | Bcrypt cost factor 12; login rate-limited to 10 attempts per IP per 15 minutes |
| IP privacy | IPs never stored raw — SHA-256 hashed before write |

## 16. Open Questions

| # | Question | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Video storage:** GridFS (simpler) vs Cloudflare R2 from day one (better global latency)? | Recommended: GridFS for MVP, R2 at 5 GB |
| 2 | **Video length limit:** 60 seconds proposed — sufficient for intros, prevents storage abuse. Adjust? | Pending client confirmation |
| 3 | **Champions Ranch logo asset:** PNG provided by client. Needs transparent background, min 300×300px. | Asset pending — client to supply |
| 4 | **Sticker sheet size:** 1×1" QR stickers on A4 proposed. Offer multiple sizes (0.75", 1.25")? | Pending client confirmation |
| 5 | **Offline/PWA:** Should the AR viewer work offline after first load? Requires service worker + video caching. | Phase 2 unless specified |
| 6 | **Sound UX:** Muted autoplay + tap-to-unmute is the only approach browsers permit. Confirmed. | Decided ✓ |
